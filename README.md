This is a simple **console-based calculator** written in Java.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations:  
➕ Addition  
➖ Subtraction  
✖️ Multiplication  
➗ Division (with zero-check handling)  

The project was developed and tested using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**.


## Features
- Perform multiple calculations in a single run.
- Supports operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Prevents division by zero with an error message.
- Clean, beginner-friendly structure using methods for each operation.

## How It Works
1. User inputs the first number.  
2. User selects an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
3. User inputs the second number.  
4. Calculator displays the result.  
5. Program asks if the user wants to perform another calculation.  


## Example Run
Enter the first number:
10

Enter the operator(+,-,*,/):
*

Enter the second number:
5

The result is: 10 * 5 = 50.0

perform another calculation?(y/n):
